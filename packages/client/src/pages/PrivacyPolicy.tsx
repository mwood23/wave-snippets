      What Information Do We Collect?
    </Heading>
    <Text mb="3">
      As described in detail below, we may collect certain identifying
      information from or about you in connection with your use of, or your
      submissions to, the Website (collectively, the "Collected Information").
      Collected Information includes, without limitation, any information that
      may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a
      first and last name, a home, business, or other physical address, a phone
      number, an email address, employer name, employer information (i.e.,
      employer address and other identifying information), and credit card
      number (and related information such as expiration date). Wave Snippets
      uses the information we collect to provide the services that are available
      via the Website.
    </Text>
    <Text mb="3">
      We require an email address from you when you register with certain Wave
      Snippets apps. We use your email for both, "functions" (e.g. sending you
      your snippet exports), “administrative” (e.g., confirming your
      registration, notifying of matches) and “promotional” (e.g., newsletters,
      new product offerings, special discounts, event notifications, special
      third- party offers) purposes. Email messages we send you may contain code
      that enables our database to track your usage of the e-mails, including
      whether the e-mail was opened and what links (if any) were clicked. You
      may opt-out of receiving promotional emails and other promotional
      communications from us at any time via the opt-out links provided in such
      communications, or by e-mailing{' '}
      <a href="mailto:wavesnippets@gmail.com">wavesnippets@gmail.com</a> with
      your specific request. However, we reserve the right to send you certain
      communications relating to Wave Snippets such as service announcements,
      security alerts, update notices, or other administrative messages) without
      affording you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such communications.
    </Text>
    <Text mb="3">
      We may periodically conduct voluntary member surveys. We encourage our
      members to participate in such surveys because they provide us with
      important information regarding the improvement of Wave Snippets. We do
      not link the survey responses to your name or email address, and all
      responses are anonymous.
    </Text>
    <Text mb="3">
      To ensure we are providing a quality service we also collect:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Device Information/Specifications. Technical information about your
          computer or mobile device (e.g., type of device, web browser or
          operating system, IP address) to analyze trends, administer the site,
          prevent fraud, track visitor movement in the aggregate, and gather
          broad demographic information.
        </li>
        <li>
          Length and Extent of Usage. How long and in what manner you used Wave

    <h3>Cookies</h3>
    <Text mb="3">
      We use “cookies” to keep track of some types of information while you are
      visiting Wave Snippets or using our services. “Cookies” are very small
      files placed on your computer, and they allow us to count the number of
      visitors to our Website and distinguish repeat visitors from new visitors.
      They also allow us and third parties we work with to save user
      preferences, track user trends, and advertise to you. We use both session
      and persistent cookies on our Website; session cookies expire at the end
      of a particular visit to our Website, while persistent cookies (also
      called stored cookies) remain active until you disable them through your
      browser settings, or until a pre-set expiration date. We rely on cookies
      for the proper operation of Wave Snippets; therefore if your browser is
      set to reject all cookies, Wave Snippets may not function properly. Users
      who refuse cookies assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of
      functionality with respect to Wave Snippets.
    </Text>
    <h3>Web Beacons</h3>
    <Text mb="3">
      “Web beacons” (also known as “clear gifs” and “pixel tags”) are small
      transparent graphic images that are often used in conjunction with cookies
      in order to further personalize Wave Snippets for our users, collect a
      limited set of information about our visitors, and advertise to our users.
      We may also use web beacons in email communications in order to understand
      the behavior of our customers, such as whether an email has been opened or
      acted upon.
